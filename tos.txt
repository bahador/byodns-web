You are anonymous because I do not know who you are.

You have no data to export because I don't collect any.

You can't close your account because you never had one.

Your private data will not be intentionally shown to other users or shared with third parties because it was never collected and other users don't exist.

You will not be served any third-party content (scripts, cookies, or images).

Your data will not be backed up regularly, because it is not collected.
