BYODNS Privacy Policy
Last updated: 19 February 2026

BYODNS has a focus on user privacy.
BYODNS does not share user data with third parties under any circumstances.
The site does not and will never show ads.
All revenue comes from paid subscriptions, removing the need for any type of tracking.
The app runs on your own device, and all third-party services or libraries are open source. There are no servers.
BYODNS does not store your payment information.
BYODNS earns all of its revenue through user subscriptions, and has no business relationship with large or small surveillance-based platforms.

Optional Analytics
If you choose to opt in, BYODNS collects anonymous usage events (features used, settings changed) and crash reports (device model, OS version, stack traces) via Google Firebase. No personal information is collected. The advertising ID is disabled.
This data is processed by Google and may be stored on servers outside the EU. Analytics data is retained for 2 months. Google Signals and all advertising features are disabled.
You can opt out at any time in Settings. When you do, collection stops immediately, locally buffered data is cleared, and your app-instance ID is reset so previous data can't be re-linked to your device.
To request deletion of data already sent to Google, use Settings > Request Data Deletion.

Your Rights
You can opt out of analytics, clear all local data, and request deletion of collected data at any time. If you're in the EU, you have full GDPR rights including access, erasure, and portability. Contact support@byodns.com to exercise them.
